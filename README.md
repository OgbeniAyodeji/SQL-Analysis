## **About SQL**

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the foundation for relational database management and data manipulation. Below are some of the key SQL capabilities I leveraged in these projects to extract, transform, and analyze data:

- **CRUD Operations**: Proficient in performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage data.
- **Advanced Joins**: Expertise in using various types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to merge data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.
- **Aggregation & Grouping**: Skilled in using aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) and GROUP BY for summarizing and analyzing data.
- **Subqueries & Nested Queries**: Ability to construct and optimize subqueries to perform advanced filtering and calculation tasks.
- **Window Functions**: Expert use of SQL window functions (e.g., RANK, ROW_NUMBER) to perform advanced analytics like ranking, moving averages, and cumulative calculations.
- **Stored Procedures & Views**: Experience in developing reusable SQL routines (stored procedures) and views for automated analysis and reporting.
- **Data Transformation**: Expertise in data normalization, cleaning, and transformation for robust analysis and accurate reporting.

For these projects, I used **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**, but the concepts and SQL techniques can be applied across different relational database platforms (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

## **How to Use**

1. **Install SQL Server**: Install a SQL database management system such as **SQL Server Express** or **MySQL** to run the SQL queries locally.
2. **Import SQL Files**: Import the provided `.sql` files into your preferred SQL environment to execute the queries.
3. **Customization**: Modify the queries to fit your specific dataset or business requirements to replicate or extend the analysis.
